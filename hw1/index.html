				<h3> I like this website because it simply  visualized the election from differnt perspectives. In the top of the website, it gives the number of electoral college number. This give people who know little electoral system direct information. Fourth graph showed shift in margin. This showed the trend of election. This shows how voter changed their stands in different states. Also, under the graphs, the table shows the information how swing states' trend which determine the result of eletion.
